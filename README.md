# SOAP_CSV-API
A SOAP-based web service built on ASP.NET Core and CoreWCF, providing an API to fetch a specific CSV file via a BasicHttpBinding endpoint. It includes WSDL metadata for client integration, enabling  an automatic proxy generation. This ensures compatibility with legacy SOAP clients while still making use of .NET Core's power and scalability.
